# Week 14

### Days 91-94: August 18-21.

**Today's Progress**: Deep learning with R.

**Thoughts** 
- I found an interesting book on deep learning - [Deep learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r). Over the past few days have read 5 chapters of this book. 
- Also these days I am actively trying to understand the tasks of machine learning that I have to solve at my new job.
